oops  

object oriented programming system

class 
object
methods
variables
  
class is a closed container where we can bind variables and methods.

-------------------------------------

class classname
{
In side class we have variables;
methods()
}
 

class demo
{
int a=10,b=20,c;
}


purpose of a variable is for accesing a value but not storing a value.
object is doing allowcation of memory to variables.obj is allowcating sufficient memory to class
method purpose it will tell what to do and how to do..


----------------------------------------

class demo
{
int a =20,b=30,c;
void add()
{
c=a+b;
}

}


--------
syntax for object

objectname.methodname();
